<h1><u>Installation Instructions</u></h1>

<h1>Prerequisites:</h1>

First, install these and make sure they work.

<h2>Python3:</h2>

A recent release is needed. Developement took place using the 3.8.x
release series. Any 3.X release <i>should</i> work, but hasn't been
tested. Under MacOSX 10.3 (panther), Python is installed by
default. Installation instructions are available at the python
website: <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>

<h2>OBD:</h2>

This is needed to communicate via the serial port. It is available
as a pip package. Install it. Version 0.7.1 was used for development.
It uses pyserial and pint included in its package.

See the <a href="https://python-obd.readthedocs.io/">Python OBD Docs</a>

<h2>WxPython:</h2>

WxPython is needed if you want to use the pretty graphical interface
to sensor data and DTC management. It's available as a pip package.
Install it. Version 4.2.1 was used for development.

<h1>Installation:</h1>

After those requirements, installation is a snap. Simply download the
release tarball and uncompress it. To "install" pyOBDA on the system, simply copy
the release directory to wherever you want (i.e. /opt, /usr/local).

To use the wx interface run <b>python3 pyobda.py</b>. If you're using
MacOSX, substitute "pythonw" for "python".
